# My vim files

I am still a beginner on Vim.

Besides vimrc, to have my configuration with supertab, you need to:

1. Download supertab.vmb to any directory.

2. Open the file in vim '''$ vim supertab.vmb'''.

3. Source the file ''':so %'''.

In order to have the spell checking for portuguese, follow this great tutorial:

I am using Wakatime in order to track my time coding. It is a great extension.
